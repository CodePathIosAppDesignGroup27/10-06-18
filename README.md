## Other App Ideas
### Dietary Restriction Tracker (by Tianyu)
 - Allows whoever plans to eat at the school dining halls to check the detailed ingrediant of dining hall food.

### Pet Adoption (by Marlene)
- An app for local shelters to practice safe adoption for pets. Many times, especially when adoptions are cheap and/or free, allows people who abuse animals to abuse and mistreat animals and there is no way to hold them accountable. People can use fake I.D.s to adopt pets because there is no way to verify that the information they are providing is real. This app will verify that the addreas and personal information is real/valid. and makes sure that the per is going to a safe home. this holds picture of the pet owners and pet for easy identification if the pet gets lost or turns up anywhre or holds someone accountable if the pet is mistreated.
